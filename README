R2D2 Processing Pitch

A human voice pitch detector in Processing based on Minim audio library.

It currently implements Autocorrelation (AMDF, which works surprisingly well) and Harmonic Product Spectrum (which doesn't work quite well yet).

PitchProject.pde shows how to use involved classes in order to extract pitch from .wav files or microphone input.
